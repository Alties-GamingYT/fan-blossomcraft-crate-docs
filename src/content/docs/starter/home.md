" Disabled Items
 * Items that are no longer supported. Just leave the item in your inventory, open a ticket, and Ill swap it out for the key that the item it came from. This eventually will be put somewhere on the wiki, but for now Ill just leave it in the patchnotes.
    * Old versions of items also must be swapped to newer versions of them (eg. Head versions of Elemental Stones to the ore version. If they are lost or broken going forwards they arent replaced)
* Titanwood Sapplings from Forest crate (not to be confused for the item it generates)
* Pinata Wand from Legacy Crate
* Event Horizon from Cosmic Crate
* Prism of Light from Fantasy Crate
* Any Pet Vouchers from crates. Although we plan on fixing it, feel free to exchange vouchers for keys as they don't work atm. "
