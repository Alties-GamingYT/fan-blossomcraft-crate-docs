Blossom Enhancement Crate: This Crate Has 












All effects in these crates are positive or neutral. Everything must give a passive effect unless stated otherwise. Each effect whether it be by right click or passive must say a level if able. There are 4 effects that don't scale in this case Fire Resistance and Water Breathing's level will be default to 3 because they are about as strong as level 3 effects in their class, and Slow Fall and Night Vision will default to level 2 because they are about as strong as level 2 effects in their class. If the level of the effect is not specified it defaults to N/A. In the case of Hero of the Village and Bad Omen, right click abilities that give these effects are considered passive.

G = Good: Gives Minecraft effects that are desireable at all times, but aren't very powerful I.E. Speed, Instant Health, Saturation, Regeneration.
P = Power: Gives certain powerful Minecraft effects that are desirable at all times I.E. Strength, Resistance, Haste, Health Boost, Absorption, Night Vision.
S = Situational: Gives Minecraft effects only useful in certain situations I.E. Jump Boost, Fire Resistance, Water Breathing, Luck, Slow Falling.
U = Unique: Gives powerful Unique Minecraft effects that are incredibly useful I.E. Conduit Power, Dolphin's Grace
(GC) = Game Changing: These effects are so unique and powerful that they are in a class of their own.
R = Rare: Has a right click ability that gives a Minecraft effect note this is always in addition to a passive effect, unless the right click is the only fair way to gain the effect.
M = Mixed: The item gives multiple effects.
B = BlossomCraft Offhand: Gives a passive BlossomCraft effect when held in the offhand and has a right click BlossomCraft ability.
(BU) = BlossomCraft Unique: The item has a passive effect unique to blossom craft when held in the offhand.
(BR) = BlossomCraft Rare: Has a right click ability unique to BlossomCraft.
(JR) = Joke Rare: Has a joke right click ability that is just for fun, replaces (BR) if The ability is unique to BlossomCraft.
J = Joke: Has a passive effect that is just for fun, replaces (BR) if The ability is unique to BlossomCraft. Effects can include Levitation, Invisibility(Debatably situational as you can hide from mobs), Glowing.
Order is as follows GPSU(GC)MB(BU)(BR)R(JR)J
If an effect type has a * next to it that means it could possibly be that effect type.
If an effect has a ~ in it's CD then the time is approximate. The point ratio is determined the same way as if it was a normal CD.

All current effect offhand items classified:

S(JR) Haanturkeys Feather: Slow Falling 2, R-Click shoot infinite eggs
(BU) Tokeans Apple: Not Healthboost but gives 4 hearts (Possible reason why it isn't Health Boost is because Health Boost hearts aren't full immediately, is seen as Health Boost 2 for scoring, Is counted as P for M classification)
PM Cathy's Reading Light: Night Vision 2, Haste 2
(BU)R Millie's Kindness: Passively heals those around you, R-Click "Health Burst" gives Regeneration 4-6 for a short period of time 5-10sec (Seen as Regeneration 5 for scoring, effect duration is seen as 7 seconds for scoring)
CD: ~60sec

(BU) Terraformer: Replants crops broken while this is in the offhand
S(GC)MR Mizzy's Poppy: Jump Boost 1, R-Click Hero of the Village 2 180sec (R-Click is counted as a passive effect)
CD: 1800sec

PM(BU) Valhalla's Shining Grace: Night Vision 2, Not Healthboost but gives 4 hearts (Possible reason why it isn't Health Boost is because Health Boost hearts aren't full immediately, is seen as Health Boost 2 for scoring, Is counted as P for M classification), Passive Effect When hit gain Absorption 3 30sec (This is how to implement Absorption in offhand items and have it be different from Health Boost or what Tokeans Apple and Valhalla's Shining Grace do. Is counted as P for M classification.)
CD:250 seconds

(BU) Whimsical Speedometer: Not Minecraft Speed (item says that it gives +0.1 speed as an enchanted armor effect, I don't know what that does exactly, Possible equivalent is Speed 5, is seen as Speed 5 for scoring)
(BU) Transmutation Orb: Sacrifices gold to prevent damage. I am unsure of the type of gold taken but it has a CD of 3-5 seconds (CD doesn't effect score since it isn't an effect with a duration)

Now to determine the rarity of effect offhand items appearing in crates

Effect Score
Minecraft Effects
Good = 20 points per level
Power = 30 points per level, Absorption is considered 1 level lower in all instances on this paper due to it being an inferior form of the BlossomCraft Health Burst equivalent effect.
Situational = 15 points per level
Unique = 40 points per level
Game Changing = 125 points per level if it is a constant effect, 30 points per level if it is an R-Click effect
Rare = Follows the point system for GPSU(GC) but is multipled by the ratio of Duration/Cooldown
Mixed = Determined by total level of all mixed GPSU(GC) effects Good effects give 8 points per level, Power effects give 12 points per level, Situational effects give 6 points per level, and uniques give 16 points per level.
BlossomCraft OffHand: 250 points, if one of the effects is just a way to get a minecraft effect 60 points plus GPSU(GC) score, if both are just ways to get a minecraft effect 100 points plus GPSU(GC) Score.
BlossomCraft Unique: 200 points, if the effect is just a way to get a minecraft effect points points are 60 plus the GPSU(GC) score. This score can only be applied once.
BlossomCraft Rare: 200 points, if the effect is just a way to get a minecraft effect 60 points plus GPSU(GC) score. This score can only be applied once.
Joke Rare = 60 additional points
Joke = Loses half of all points
* = *ed effect types give half as many points. In this case the ghost doll is the only one with this symbol and it's listed a J* so instead it loses only a quarter of all points.

GPSU(GC) normal 20/30/17/40/130
GPSU(GC)M 8/12/6/16/(50 R-Click = 12)





----------





Scoring:

Haanturkey's Feather = S51 + (JR)80 = 131
Tokeans Apple = (BU)60 + P60 = 120
Cathy's Reading Light = P60 + P60 = 120
Millie's Kindness = (BU)200 + R((G100 x 7/60) = R11/7) = 211.7
Terraformer = (BU)200 = 200
Mizzy's Poppy = S17 + (GC)90 + M42 + R(((GC)375) x 1/10 = 37.5) = 186.5
Valhalla's Shining Grace = P60 + (BU)60 + P60 + P30 + M60 = 270
Whimsical Speedometer = G100 = 100
Transmutation Orb = (BU)200 = 200
Raid Seeker = (GC)90 + R(((GC)375 x 1/10) = 127.5
Mana Crystal = G40 + P60 + S34 + M64 = 198
Aether Lantern = P30 + P60 + M36 + R((P60 x 1/2) = 30) = 156
Hexcore = G20 + P30 + P30 + M32 = 112
Smokey's Lantern = P60 + P60 + M24 = 144
Christmas Orb = G40 + P60 + S17 + M46 = 161
Mimir's Head = (GC)125 = 125
Valhalla's Call = (BU)200 = 200
Hamingja's Luck = S15 = 15
Asgardian Gem = P30 + P30 + M24 = 84
Devil Fruit = G60 + P60 = 120
Laffey's Ocean Water = P60 + S45 + U80 = 185
Grandad's Walking Stick = G60 + P60 + P30 = 150
Swam's Bottle O'Slay = G40 + G20 + S15 = 75
Spake's Gold Miner = (BU)200 = 200
Darcy's Bubble Booster = P30 + S45 + R((U120 x 1/2) = 60) = 135
LeooKnightus's Redbull = P60 + G40 + S30 + (JR)60 = 190
BritishBears's Claw = G40 + P40 + (BU)200 = 280

Kunv's Magical Salmon = G40 + P60 + S15 + M (I am not knowledgeable about how the absorption works here. This implements absorbtion differently to Valhalla's Shining Grace, it's a more powerful implementation)

Manmetgeweer's Gyros = G40 = 40
Byte's Lucky Nugget = G100 + S60 = 160
Ball's Bouncy Ball = (BU)200 + J-100 = 100
Ghost Doll: (BU)60 + G40 + J*-50 = 50

That's all of them folks!





----------





I think for Tokeans Apple and Valhalla's Shininbg Grace that these should be seen as the proper way to implement Health Boost, Health Boost should not have the need to heal to full.

I think Instant Health should be an effect but should be a right click effect and have a cooldown close to that of absorption

I will ignore Kunv's salmon for now

Okay so the basic offhand item scores and what appears where. These are in the what I am going to call the Enhancement Crate which is the first crate from my suggestion, it cannot have Unique or Game Changing effects whatsoever. 


I'm also going to list possible rarity ranges. A# = Attempt (number#): The probability of getting each item in the pool. Attempt 1 has the maximum score set to 60. A3 has the maximum score set to 75. Attempt 3 has the Maximum score set to 100.

	5 Lesser Pheonix Potions


Rarity pool 1 <30 A1:35% A2:35% A3:35%

A2 = .58%
A3 = .83%


----------
There is a cutoff here because the effects that appear below this are not necessary in the Enhancement Crate. I would like them to be in the crate and I would suggest to put them because they are cool, but I want the Crate to be something Active players can get I.E. through voting by lucky vote chance, the vote shop for 40 votes, 1 is given as a reward whenever you rank up, starting when you reach Ranger, and 1 more is given per rank after Ranger, Whenever you hit a level that is a multiple of 25 for your job you get given 1, finally you can buy it on the BlossomCraft website for 2-3 dollars a small reward for a small donation to support BlossomCraft, also you get 2 when you buy a rank and gives you double for each level of rank you buy so celestial would grant 32 keys in total. I don't think the rank prices should change though. I do think the rank rewards should change to not give any money though because if you get a bad draw you can just sell the item for a good amount of money, Asgardian gem which has the lowest score out of all the current offhand items goes for 20k, or at least it's selling on the AH in spirit for that much, by extrapolating this a single effect offhand item that is level 1 would be worth 3k-6k depending on effect type but an item with a level 2-4 effect may theoretically earn 8k-18k passive resistance 2 is pretty dang nice. Lesser Pheonix Potions are worth 2k-3k. Let's say a Celestial gets 32 level 1 items and Lesser Pheonix potions I'm gonna average this out below and calculate how much money they would get, I'm not gonna write out my math but I will attempt to a bit. The effect items below this do not need to be in the Enhancement Crate.
----------
Chance of getting pool 1 items out of the 65% these three pools make up = 53.8%
Chance of getting pool 2 items out of the 65% these three pools make up = 38.5%
Chance of getting 5 Lesser Pheonix Potions = 7.7%

Chance of getting certain item out of pool 1 if only drawing from pool 1 = 16.7%
Chance of getting a certain item out of pool 2 if only drawing from pool 2 = 12.5%

Chance of getting a Situational item from pool 1 if only drawing from pool 1 = 33.3%
Chance of getting a Good item from pool 1 if only drawing from pool 1 = 66.7%

Chance of getting a Power item from pool 2 if only drawing from pool 2 = 62.5%
Chance of getting a Situational item from pool 2 if only drawing from pool 2 = 37.5%
Chance of getting only Power items from pool 2 = 24%

Remaking the calculations so that the total excludes level 2 items
Chance of getting pool 1 items out of the new 54% these three pools make up = 64.8%
Chance of getting pool 2 items out of the 54% these three pools make up = 44.4%
Chance of getting 5 Lesser Pheonix Potions = 9.3%

Odds of each item class
Chance of getting a Good item of level 1 = 43.2% 
Chance of getting a Power item of level 1 = 33.8%
Chance of getting a Situational item of level 1 = 18%
Chance of gettin 5 Lesser Pheonix Potion = 9.3%

32 x 43.2% = 13.824 Level 1 Good items = 4.5k
32 x 33.8% = 10.816 Level 1 Power items = 6k
32 x 18% = 5.76 Level 1 Situational items = 3k
32 x 9.3% = 2.976 x 5 Lesser Pheonix Potions = 2-3k so 2.5k

Rounding so there are 32 items and calculating approximately how much money they could get you
14 Level 1 Good items = 63k
10 Level 1 Power items = 60k
5 Level 1 Situational items = 15k
3 x 5 Lesser Pheonix Potion = 7.5k
Total = 145.5k

This may flood the market actually. Therefore you should be able to trade these items with the same effect for ones of an effect a level higher than it. I think they should require 3 of the items because haste 2 could arguably go for 18k-20k.

Rarity pool 5 <80 A2:5% A3:5%
-----------------------------

	S75 Jump Boost 5, Luck 5

Chance of each item
A2 = 2.5%
A3 = 2.5%





----------
The one above is different from the ones below because I think these ones may not truly belong in the Enhancement Crate as it is just meant to reward active players with some nice offhand items but these ofFhand items effects are extremely powerful and can't be obtained normally except Absorption by an enchanted golden apple which is a very difficult item to get hence it's price in BlossomCraft.
----------





Rarity pool 6 <100 A3:2.5%
--------------------------

	G80 Speed 4, Instant Health 4, Regeneration 4, Saturation 4
	P90 Strength 3, Resistance 3, Haste 3, Health Boost 3, Absorption 4

Chance of each item
A3 = .27-.28%
